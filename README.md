# UCBLogo

In this fork, I added wasm (wasmer webc to be exact) as new building target and wasmer-js/xtermjs as new terminal for my own project. Exact building details can be found in the new target, `wasm`, added to the `Makefile.am`. Briefly, a wasm binary is first built with the specialized wasmer-js/xtermjs terminal. Then a Binaryen optimizer with asyncify gets applied to the newly make wasm binary. After that, three sets of resources, `csls`, `helpfiles` and `logolib`, are copied and packaged together with optimized wasm into a v3 webc container. The whole building process can be done in the dev container which has a version at `ghcr.io/yunhailuo/ucblogo-code:wasi-webc-dev`.

## Berkeley Logo interpreter

## About this project

This uses the repository https://github.com/jrincayc/ucblogo-code
created for further UCBLogo development.

Changes for this release:
* Added optional object oriented LOGO features ( --enable-objects )
* autoconf based build system
* Variety of bug fixes

Here is an overview of the repository:
* csls - Programs form [Brian Harvey's trilogy "Computer Science Logo Style"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/).
* docs - Usermanual in variety formats and brief manual page.
* helpfiles - files for UCBLogo interactive help.
* test - Unit tests.
* / - program source code and [a Program Logic Manual](/plm).

The executable file in this distribution includes libraries from the
[wxWidgets project](http://wxwidgets.org/).  The Microsoft Windows version
is distributed with runtime library libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll and libstdc++-6.dll,
from the [MinGW project](http://www.mingw.org/).
Those libraries are also covered by the Gnu GPL.  We
do not distribute their source code; you can download it from their
respective web sites.

## Usage

To build Logo under *nix, install wxWidgets and other dependencies
and then do this:
```
	autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make
```

Note that if you don't have autoconf, the release .tar.gz have already built
configure files.
